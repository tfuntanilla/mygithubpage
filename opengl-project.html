                    Two months later and this project is completed! I got super busy with school so I didn't have time to update this post with all the phases of the project.
                    Aside from the basic 3D viewing, the final program also has lighting, different types of shading, texture mapping, the software implementation of the graphics pipeline, and other 
                    little things. Computer graphics was the most time-consuming class I've ever taken in college, but I enjoyed it a lot and found it to be very rewarding 
                    in the end. I got an A in the course, too, so I was pretty happy.

                    I'll probably not post the entire source code or made it publicly available through GitHub since it was a class project, and the professor might use
                    the same project requirements in the future. I'll make posts on the bits I found most interesting while I was working on this project so it could
                    hopefully help those learning OpenGL and Qt.

                    This project is for the computer graphics course I am taking this quarter. It's the first phase of a quarter-long
                    project, so right now it's just a basic 3D viewer. Still, I spend HOURS on this phase of the project. I didn't know anything
                    about OpenGL prior to taking this class so there was such a huge learning curve. I enjoyed it though.

                    The program works by loading a scene from a JSON file, which has information about the objects (saved in .obj format), and then renders those object.
                    There's a camera that allows you to navigate the scene using mouse countrols, and then you can also select and transform individual
                    objects. It allows you to switch between wire frame and color-filled rendering and between perspective and orthographic projections. After making
                    changes to the loaded scene, you can save the scene to a JSON file so you can restore it later.

                    Here's an overview of what the app looks like:

                    My code is on GitHub, but since it's an ongoing project, I have it on private for now. Nonetheless, I'm pretty excited for the other phases of this project.
                    I'll update this post as I complete them.
