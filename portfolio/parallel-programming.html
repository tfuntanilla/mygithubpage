            Just last winter quarter, I learned parallel programming, and I really like how much better of a programmer
            I became because of it. I'm now able to code really fast programs using
            <a href="http://openmp.org/wp/">OpenMP</a>,
            <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/snow/index.html">R Snow</a>,
            <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/about-cuda">CUDA</a>, and
            <a href="http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/thrust/#axzz3VNHXr11r">Thrust</a>. As someone who really loves to
            program, it makes me really
            happy.
            <br><br>
            For our final project, I worked with three of my peers in parallelizing the
            combn() function from the R CRAN package <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/combinat/index.html">
            'combinat'</a>. This function is pretty straightforward. As per its official documentation, the combn()
            function: "Generate all combinations of the elements of x taken m at a time." Click
            <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/combinat/combinat.pdf">here</a> for a more detailed
            description.
            <br><br>
            The goal of the project is to write a new version of the function that works exactly like the original
            version (handles the same types of inputs, produces the same results for same inputs, etc.),
            except the new one is parallelized using OpenMP, R Snow, CUDA, and/or Thrust (we choose three, R Snow
            is required). Even though the combn() function seems straightforward, this project was quite challenging
            because we had to think of ways that doesn't simply parallelize the implementation, but actually makes
            the program run faster. It's quite easy to convert the original code into a parallelize version,
            but it's another thing to actually make considerable speed improvements. There are many factors to consider
            depending on the platform being used, such as arranging good cache behavior, managing shared memory usage,
            etc. Another challenging was aspect was handling the input and output for the function.
            The codes for OpenMP, CUDA, and Thrust need to be written with C++, and going from handling
            R data types to C++ data types definitely involved quite some work.
            <br><br>
            It was a challenging project, but overall I was very happy with the speed improvements that my grouped
            achieved, except for our R Snow implementation, which for a reason I haven't figured out, achieved the
            exact opposite of our goal. The following charts show the improvements in speeds for inputs up to millions in
            size. I'm hastily making this post right now so I can update this site before I get super busy again, but
            I also plan to share the approaches that we took to make the program run faster (in OpenMP and Thrust, at
            least).
