        <h3>Interviews... interviews... interviews</h3>
        <div class="date">
            01/09/2015
        </div>
        <p>
            I applied to a couple of companies I'm interested in from October to November 2014. The fastest
            to reply to me was Google (got a response from a recruiter one business day after I submitted my
            application). I had my first phone interview with a Google software engineer just before Thanksgiving last
            year, and it went well so I'm moving on to the next round. Ever since that interview, I've gotten responses
            from most of the other companies I applied to so I've been doing coding exercises, online technical quizzes,
            and phone interviews for these companies since late November. I generally like doing the coding exercises
            since those help me review data structures and algorithms. I've also been asked behavioral questions
            in some of the first round phone interviews I had, but if you do some preparations beforehand, those aren't
            really hard to answer. I've never been asked something completely unusual.<br><br>

            So far, I never had problems passing the initial screenings and first round technical interviews. Next
            week, I have four second/third round technical interviews (all over the phone, one is with Google)
            in addition to two info sessions (both companies I'm really interested in) and a career fair I have to go
            to.
            I'm not even halfway into the interview/hiring process for any of these companies yet, but it's already
            quite stressful. I've always known that this process takes a really long time for almost all tech companies,
            which is why I started applying early. They all kind of ask the same types of questions but at the
            same time they kind of don't, so I still get nervous every time. I still have a bunch of other companies
            I'd like to talk to at the career fair so assuming they at least find my resume interesting, I'll probably
            have at least one interview every week for the rest of this quarter.<br><br>

            I'm hoping to secure a job before spring break so hopefully these interviews go well... I'm keeping
            notes of the interview questions I've been asked so far so I can make posts about them (only those I could
            legally share, of course) when all of these are over.
